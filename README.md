# sklearn-gradio-wasm-demo
A demo of running sklearn totally in-browser via gradio-lite.

This shows how scikit-learn can be used purely in the browser via [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), a library that transpiles Python code to Javascript. This allows someone to run PCA dimensional reduction in the browser.

This could theoretically be used to run pyodide-compatible Python in the browser, to drive Pol.is-like data pipelines without processing data on backend.
